# color-namer-palette
A color picker application, which suggests a variety of modifications to the current selection, such as lighter and darker versions, more and less saturated versions, other colors similar in hue, and complimentary colors (180, 120 and 90 degree hue change).

## Color Name Recognition

Part of the color namer palette program is being able to recognize color names. This includes both tying an RGB value to color names as well as recognizing a given RGB value and naming it. Using auto complete / typing suggestions for the color names we can suggest names or fix spelling mistakes.

## Color Matching

As many know, there are complimentary colors, as well as palette tones, which helps in creating small color palettes, useful for web design or UI design.

### Symmetries in Color Matching

The most common color matching symmetry is the 180 degree shift, or in other words, the color opposite any given color on the color wheel. So red (hue of 0 degrees) is the compliment (180 degree shift) of cyan (hue of 180 degrees).

Other matches include 120 degree shifts, 90 degree shifts, and others. These symmetries maintain brightness and saturation values, only changing hue.
